# What is vxt?

__vxt__ is a path tracer renderer written in C++, based on the book Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley. The purpose of this project is purely academic as this is my first contact with path tracing techniques! So far so fun :^) 

# Building

_[A vs2017 Solution is provided by default]_

This project uses [GENie.lua](https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie) to create the project solution. Open a CMD in the root directory and execute the following commands to re-create a solution:

	cd project
	..\tools\genie [parameters] <vs2017|vs2015>
	
The solution will be located in _project/vs/vxt-Raytracer.sln_.
